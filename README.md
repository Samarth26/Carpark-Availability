# Carpark-Availability
This application helps you find the nearest car parks and petrol stations in Singapore. The application is in Typescript and Javascript. We used a MEAN Stack (Mongo, Express, Angular & Node) to create the application. We populate the map, distances, and time to destination using data.gov.sg and google maps api.
